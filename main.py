                ## üóÇÔ∏è About the Dataset

The dataset used for this model is from the [Fertilizer Prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gdabhishek/fertilizer-prediction/data) available on Kaggle. It contains data on various factors affecting the choice of fertilizer for crops, including temperature, humidity, moisture, soil type, crop type, and the levels of nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. The target variable is the type of fertilizer recommended for the given conditions.

The dataset is valuable for building predictive models that can assist farmers in making informed decisions about fertilizer application to enhance crop yield and sustainability.








## üìÅ About the ML Model

This machine learning model is designed to predict the appropriate fertilizer for crops based on various input features. The key steps involved in developing this model include:

### Data Preprocessing and EDA:

The dataset is read from a CSV file and inspected for basic information such as column names, unique values, and missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the distribution of continuous variables (Temperature, Humidity, Moisture, Nitrogen, Potassium, Phosphorus) using histograms and box plots, and to explore the relationship of categorical variables (Soil Type, Crop Type) with the target variable (Fertilizer) using count plots and box plots.
                
### Label Encoding:

Categorical variables (Soil_Type, Crop_Type, Fertilizer) are encoded into numerical values using LabelEncoder to prepare the data for modeling.
                
### Data Splitting:

The dataset is split into training and test sets using an 80/20 ratio.
                
### Model Training and Evaluation:

A RandomForestClassifier is trained on the training data.
GridSearchCV is used to tune hyperparameters (n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split) for the RandomForest model to improve performance.
The best model is evaluated on the test set, and its performance is assessed using classification metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
